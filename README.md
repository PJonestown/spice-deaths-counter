## Spice-deaths Counter

**A site that counts the amount of ppl dead or hospitalized from the synthetic drug Spice.**

*As I'm just starting to learn Rails, I'd love to get some help to get this site up and out there asap.*

### Features

* Death counter
* Hospitalized counter (if possible to get a somewhat right number)
* *Victims:* Name/Age/City/Country/Link(info/newspaper) of all victims
* *Links:* Any kind of "learn more" information about the topic


#### Thoughts

Lets fuel the fire of todays debate about the dangers of the (somewhat) legal drug spice.
Young ppl that do not want to break the law so instead of smoking cannabis they buy Spice.
I feel lucky not to be one of those that never wake up after.
